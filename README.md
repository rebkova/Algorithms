Basic algorithms and their codes

1 BINARY SEARCH
- Requires sorted list/array.
- It searches for the required item in the list/array of items by repeatedly dividing the list/array in halves untill it finds the correct item.
- Number of guessings = log2n. n = length of an array

2 SELECTION SORT
- Does not require sorted list/array.
- Finds min value of an array and swaps it with the first item in an array. Iterates through subarrays.
